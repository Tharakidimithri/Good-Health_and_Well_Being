                We,the showcase the creation of a website Good Health and Well-Being using HTML,
                 CSS, and JavaScript. I created the User profile with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                 There are 4 steps which ask the user for prompts, and each time the user completes one step, 
                 the answers entered by the user are displayed. The progression bar also scales when the user 
                 completes each step. These functions are done using Javascript. 
                 I created the team page using HTML and CSS.Its a page where it displays the team members.
                 The hover effect when the user points over one member is created by CSS .I created the content page using HTML and CSS.
                 The navigation bar and the footer is displayed by the CSS styles.And you can click buttons 
                 where it includes links to the bottom of the page for smooth navigation
